Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition

This is the source release of Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition by General Arcade and Devolver Digital, forked from https://github.com/TermiT/duke3d-megaton.
The source code was provided on that repository "as-is", with no help to build it.
Included is a Visual Studio Solution and project files for compiling on Windows

Data Files
The Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition game data files are not included in this release as they are still under its EULA.
Unfortunately, the Megaton Edition is no longer available on Steam to purchase due to the rights to the Duke Nukem IP transfered from Devolver Digital to Gearbox Software, and subsequently removed and replaced by 20th Anniversary World Tour Editon.
